                <p class="caption">The Ogilvy.com website shows a great example of contrast in its design.  The black text and white background are very simple and contrasting colors.  This makes the text and content much easier to read.</p>
                <p class="caption">The Red color also brings a lot of contrast with the rest of the UI.  This brings the focus to the logo and where you tap or hover the cursor.</p>
                <p class="caption">There is also contrast in the typeface/font choices.  The logo of the company is a fancier serif font, while the menu and captions are in a simple and thin sans-serif font.  This is done to add visual intrest and differentiate the title and content.</p>
                <p class="caption">There is even contrast in the hard lines of the screen and images with the edge of the floating bar at the top that fades into the content, providing beter flow into the content and better divisions between the different images.</p>

                        <p class="caption">The Target.com website shows a simple but very effective use of color on a website.  They are using a split-complementary color scheme with red as the main color, and a split between the warmer and cooler greens oposite on the color wheel.</p>
                        <p class="caption"> The menu bar and logo at the top of the page just use the red to stick to main branding and clearly contrast the content of the page.  The content on the page uses blue-green as the background and the warmer green as the focal point.  the colors also tie the page together very well with the blues, and light pinks drawing attention down the page in a zig-zag pattern.</p>
                        <p class="caption">The colors chosen also fit the "Fresh start" campaign being advertised on the page, with mint and leaf green realting the content to being fresh and new for the new year.</p>

To show the relationships between the different elements of the page, and the periodic table, the website groups them up leaving the perfect amount of margin between groups.</p>

                                <p class="caption">In the menue there are more great examples of visual alignment with the three columns of icons.  I have found in most websights that having 3 columns works incredibly well for icons on a mobile device.  The options at the top are also neatly set apart from the heatmaps below and are even closer together to show the relationship between the two elements.</p>
